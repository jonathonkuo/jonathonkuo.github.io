Aside from getting set up in our office, I spent the day continuing to learn HTML and CSS and working on this website. Additionally, I began to
become familiar with Alice Version 2 by experimenting with the interface and reading supplemental materials.

To begin the day, I completed the Duke Responsible Conduct of Research Training, learning about proper methods of data collection, analysis, and publication.
Next, I became familiar with basic Alice concepts by completing our "Shark Attack!" tutorial. Through this introductory tutorial, I learned about scene setup, cameras, objects, methods,
and events in Alice. Taking a break from learning Alice, I gained more perspective on the language and project by reading Dr. Rodger's paper, <i>Growing a K-12 Community of Practice</i>. This paper is cited and summarized below.
Looking to become more familiar with Alice, I completed the longer "Princess and Dragon Version 2 - Introduction to Alice" tutorial, which solidified my understanding of the basics
and also introduced loops, properties, functions, and the difference between object-level and world-level methods. Additionally, I read a few of the lesson plans
created by previous workshops' teachers to gain a more concrete understanding of the applications of Alice. Finally, I completed a couple more tutorials - 
"How Tall Are You? Introducing Decisions and the use of Functions" as well as "Headshots in Alice" - to learn more about Alice and its features.

Summary:<br>
In this report of experiences, the authors share what they have learned through their attempts to build and grow a community of practice 
for middle and high school teachers aimed at using Alice to teach basic computational thinking. In contrast to other National Science Foundation Innovative
Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers grant winners, the authors were faced with the challenge of integrating a wholly new 
subject into education. Without existing computer science departments or existing curricula, a community of practice for K-12
teachers was essential for the success of the professional development of teachers in K-12 computer science education. Thus, the authors built an Alice community of practice
through professional development workshops in three states, curricular materials available online, teacher-made materials like lesson
plans, school-year support, Alice community communication through an e-mail listserv, a symposium to share progress,
and 3D Alice model creation to help teachers more effectively integrate the language into their curricula.
Through doing this work, the authors learned many important lessons that drastically impact the success 
of the Alice Project and provide insight into K-12 computer science education. Some of these lessons include:
the importance of the location of workshops (hosting workshops appears to be much more effective than travelling
to teachers), issues with maintaining school-year interactions with teachers, the usefulness of developing
local sub-communities of practice as they can work together to solve problems, the problems with education
bureacracy that stand in the way of many teachers, and many more salient points. The authors hope that
the sharing of these experiences and lessons learned will help others in their work to build other communities of practice.
