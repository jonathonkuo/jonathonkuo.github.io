Aside from getting set up in our office, I spent the day continuing to learn HTML and CSS and working on this website. Additionally, I began to
become familiar with Alice Version 2 by experimenting with the interface and reading supplemental materials.

To begin the day, I completed the Duke Responsible Conduct of Research Training, learning about proper methods of data collection, analysis, and publication.
Next, I became familiar with basic Alice concepts by completing our "Shark Attack!" tutorial. Through this introductory tutorial, I learned about scene setup, cameras, objects, methods,
and events in Alice. Taking a break from learning Alice, I gained more perspective on the language and project by reading Dr. Rodger et al.'s paper, <i>Growing a K-12 Community of Practice</i>. This paper is cited and summarized below (reachable via the link).
Looking to become more familiar with Alice, I completed the longer "Princess and Dragon Version 2 - Introduction to Alice" tutorial, which solidified my understanding of the basics
and also introduced loops, properties, functions, and the difference between object-level and world-level methods. Additionally, I read a few of the lesson plans
created by previous workshops' teachers to gain a more concrete understanding of the applications of Alice. Finally, I completed a couple more tutorials - 
"How Tall Are You? Introducing Decisions and the use of Functions" as well as "Headshots in Alice" - to learn more about Alice and its features.

<p title="Wednesday, May 24th">
To start, I gained a broader view of the work by reading a few more papers about the Alice Project, including <i>Weaving Computing into all Middle School Disciplines</i> as well as <i>Integrating Computing into Middle School Disciplines Through Projects</i>.
These are cited and summarized below. I then completed some of the topical Alice tutorials, to learn more about the specifics of the language. 
The tutorials included: "Kangaroo Visits Friends: Making Methods More Flexible with Parameters", "Changing Color: Advanced Functions", 
"Creating Simple Objects with Shapes and Textures: Texture Maps", "Making Objects Move in Unison: Using Lists", and 
"Bunny Eat Broccoli: Repetition - Simple loops and Conditional loops".
These tutorials introduced me to Alice's implementation of parameters and variables, custom functions, textures and texture maps, lists, and
repetition/iteration. To end the day, I read a few more papers, including <i>Engaging Middle School Teachers and Students with Alice in a Diverse Set of Subjects</i>, <i>Enhancing K-12 Education with Alice Programming Adventures</i>, and
<i>Influence of the Familiarization with “Scratch” on Future Teachers’ Opinions and Attitudes about Programming and ICT in Education</i>.

    Summary:<br>
    With middle and high school being such a formative time in people's lives and the tendency to make career decisions
    in that time, the authors aim to use Alice as a way of exposing computer science as a viable and interesting future to all kinds of people.
    In order to do this, Alice can be implemented in a multifarious set of subjects, including math, science, language arts,
    history, art, and technology. Through summer workshops, middle and high school teachers were able to develop lesson
    plans in all of these subjects. Furthermore, through summer camps, students themselves were exposed to Alice, showing
    a high level of interest. Following tutorials, students were able to use the programming skills they had learned in
    order to build their own worlds in their free time. This shows how students are willing to engage in computing if given
    the opportunity.

    Summary:<br>
    Due to the large number of students using technology and the low number of students understanding computer science, 
    the authors looked to use Alice as an introduction into computing and animation concepts. By developing materials for teachers and
    students to use, as well as by working with teachers at workshops, the authors worked to integrate Alice into schools.
    The authors cite their work in creating tutorials in getting started, animation effects, creating objects, computer
    science concepts, quizzes, and more. The authors provide examples of Alice worlds centered around the subjects of 
    math and music. For example, an Alice world was created that involved a game where the goal was to identify instruments.
    The authors have found that there are a multitude of objects that could be useful to teachers that are not available
    in Alice yet. For instance, a history teacher would be able to utilize objects representing presidents and U.S. government buildings.
    Working with teachers closely and using their feedback, the authors continue to work to create materials like tutorials
    and template classes.

Summary:<br>
In this report of experiences, the authors share what they have learned through their attempts to build and grow a community of practice 
for middle and high school teachers aimed at using Alice to teach basic computational thinking. In contrast to other National Science Foundation Innovative
Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers grant winners, the authors were faced with the challenge of integrating a wholly new 
subject into education. Without existing computer science departments or existing curricula, a community of practice for K-12
teachers was essential for the success of the professional development of teachers in K-12 computer science education. Thus, the authors built an Alice community of practice
through professional development workshops in three states, curricular materials available online, teacher-made materials like lesson
plans, school-year support, Alice community communication through an e-mail listserv, a symposium to share progress,
and 3D Alice model creation to help teachers more effectively integrate the language into their curricula.
Through doing this work, the authors learned many important lessons that drastically impact the success 
of the Alice Project and provide insight into K-12 computer science education. Some of these lessons include:
the importance of the location of workshops (hosting workshops appears to be much more effective than travelling
to teachers), issues with maintaining school-year interactions with teachers, the usefulness of developing
local sub-communities of practice as they can work together to solve problems, the problems with education
bureacracy that stand in the way of many teachers, and many more salient points. The authors hope that
the sharing of these experiences and lessons learned will help others in their work to build other communities of practice.

   Summary:<br>
   The authors point out the fact that computer programming is generally difficult to learn and has higher
	  failure rates than other subjects. Because of this, many efforts have been made to increase
	  attendance and decrease the difficulty of introductory programming education. One such effort
	  has been the development of user-friendly programming environments, like Alice and Scratch.
	  The authors describe Scratch, a project of MIT Media Lab, pointing out its drag-and-drop structure, 
	  integration of computational concepts, large network of users, and aesthetic design. To learn more
	  about the effects of Scratch, the authors performed a study to test the effect of the level of
	  familiarity with Scratch on the opinions and attitudes of future teachers on Information and
	  Communication Technologies (ICT). To do so, pre-education students of the University of the Aegean (Greece)
	  were exposed to Scratch through a mandatory course and were given surveys before and after.
	  The initial survey showed little experience in computer programming within the group, and 
	  a relatively high level of anxiety about the subject. Despite this, the initial survey also showed
	  that these students were interested in using ICT in education. The final survey showed that
	  familiarity with a user-friendly programming environment like Scratch increased the interest in using
	  ICT in education and significantly decreased the stress and anxiety regarding their ability to 
	  utilize ICT in education. This information confirms and validates the decision to use
	  Scratch in an introductory computer programming course.

Summary:<br>
With middle schoolers' low amount of exposure to computer science, the authors developed Alice-based curriculum materials
for teachers. These materials can be used to introduce students to basic programming and animation concepts.
The authors describe in detail specific projects that have been developed for science and math classrooms,
but also emphasize the potential for Alice in other disciplines like history and foreign language. For science, Alice can be used to model
experiments to visualize phenomena like overfishing as well as to view microscopic subjects. For math,
the authors have found a multitude of applications for Alice, including functions, points, percentages, 
inequalities, sampling, and more. The authors conclude with a few statistics collected from their workshops,
showing that math teachers generally showed the highest aptitude for programming, while technology teachers showed the most interest.
Additionally, projects that involved an interactive game introduced the highest number of Alice/programming concepts compared to projects that
had students create their own worlds and presentation-only projects. The authors continue to create
Alice tutorials and projects to further the work of integrating computing into middle school education.

Summary:<br>
Given the deficiency of computer science education in American middle schools, the authors worked to teach 
middle school teachers of a wide variety of disciplines Alice in an attempt to integrate computing into their
classes. The authors describe their work with teachers, which includes workshops, materials, and outreach. In
the two-week summer workshops, middle school teachers are exposed to introductory and topical tutorials in order
to become familiar with the programming environment. Additionally, the workshops introduce teachers to helper objects
that can help teachers and students to develop animations more effectively; one example of a helper object is a quiz
object that helps to assess understanding. Furthermore, teachers can give their students Alice challenges, wherein
the students are given a world with a few missing pieces, giving them an opportunity to program and develop their
understanding of class materials. Finally, the authors provide sample projects and worlds online that could serve
as useful tools in the classroom. These could ask a science student to construct the solar system or a math student
to demonstrate her understanding of the coordinate system. An important outcome of the workshops are teacher-created
lesson plans that clearly outline how an Alice world can be used for a certain concept. Altogether, these materials
are available for free online for teachers and students to access. Moreover, the authors have worked with students
in the classroom, who showed an aptitude and an interest in computing, showing the importance of the work. Through
curriculum materials and proffessional development of teachers, the authors (and teachers) are continuing to work on integrating
computer science into K-12 education.
